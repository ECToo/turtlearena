#summary Player structure

*Player* (playable character) structure. Players have three models that are attached using "tags". Weapons are also attached using tags.

= Locating the data =
All of the data files are stored in base/assets0.pk3, which is simply a renamed .zip file.
Pk3 files can be extracted with any zip program.

= Files =
Players are stored in "base/models/players/PLAYERNAME/", in the release the data is zipped into base/assets0.pk3 (which is simply a renamed .zip)

  * head.md3 - Head model, it will be attached to torso.md3
  * torso.md3 - Upper model, it will be attached to legs.md3
  * legs.md3 - Lower model
  * animation.cfg - Contains animations and other settings for the player
  * Default skin
  ** icon_default.png - Icon for the default skin
  ** head_default.skin - Shaders for head default skin
  ** torso_default.skin - Shaders for torso default skin
  ** legs_default.skin - Shaders for legs default skin
  * Red teamplay skin
  ** icon_red.png
  ** head_red.skin
  ** torso_red.skin
  ** legs_red.skin
  * Blue teamplay skin
  ** icon_blue.png
  ** head_blue.skin
  ** torso_blue.skin
  ** legs_blue.skin


= Skins =
Skins are made up of three ".skin" files and a icon image (.png/.tga/.jpg). The skins default, red, and blue should be include to support all gametypes. Extra skins can be include, for example Raph has a "fugitoid" skin.

  * icon_SKINNAME.png - Icon for the skin
  * head_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for head
  * torso_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for torso
  * legs_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for legs

== Teamplay skins ==
In teamplay gametypes, there can be per-team skins stored in "models/players/PLAYERNAME/TEAMNAME/". TEAMNAME is set to g_blueTeam (default:Katanas) or g_redTeam (default:Sais).

== .skin Format ==
*.skin* files set the shaders used by the model. MD3 models contain "meshes" (Groups of triangles), each must have a shader listed. The "tags" (points where other models are attached) are also listed.

Example: Raph's head_default.skin
{{{
h_head,models/players/raph/head
h_head2,models/players/raph/head
h_eye_left,models/players/raph/white
h_eye_right,models/players/raph/white
h_mouth_left,models/players/raph/white
h_mouth_right,models/players/raph/white
tag_head,
}}}

TMNT Arena also supports using *$(dir)* instead of the directory where the player is.
Example: "$(dir)/head" instead of "models/players/raph/head".

= animation.cfg =
animation.cfg contains the animations and other settings. The animation.cfg is normally created when exporting a player model to MD3.

== soundpath ==
By placing "soundpath NAME" in animation.cfg the player will use sounds from "sound/NAME/" instead of "sound/PLAYERNAME/". Soundpath defaults to the player's directory name.
