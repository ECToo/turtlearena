#summary Player structure

*Player* (playable character) structure. Players have three models that are attached to multiple animations are play at once and the seperate models can turn. There are required skins default, red, and blue.


= Files =

  * head.md3 - Head model, attached to torso.md3
  * torso.md3 - Upper model, attached to legs.md3
  * legs.md3 - Lower model
  * animation.cfg - Contains animations and other settings for the player
  * icon_default.png - Icon for the default skin
  * head_default.skin - Shaders for head default skin
  * torso_default.skin - Shaders for torso default skin
  * legs_default.skin - Shaders for legs default skin

  * icon_red.png
  * head_red.skin
  * torso_red.skin
  * legs_red.skin

  * icon_blue.png
  * head_blue.skin
  * torso_blue.skin
  * legs_blue.skin


= Skins =
Skins are made up of three ".skin" files and a icon image (.png/.tga/.jpg). Extra skins can be include, for example Raph has a "fugitoid" skin.

  * icon_SKINNAME.png - Icon for the skin
  * head_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for head
  * torso_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for torso
  * legs_SKINNAME.skin - Shaders for legs


== .skin Format ==
*.skin* files set the shaders used by the model. Model's contain "meshes" (Groups of triangles), each must have a shader listed. The "tags" (points where other models are attached) are also listed.

Example: Raph's head_default.skin
{{{
h_head,models/players/raph/head
h_head2,models/players/raph/head
h_eye_left,models/players/raph/white
h_eye_right,models/players/raph/white
h_mouth_left,models/players/raph/white
h_mouth_right,models/players/raph/white
tag_head,
}}}

TMNT Arena also supports using *$(dir)* instead of the directory where the player is.
Example: "$(dir)/head" instead of "models/players/raph/head".
