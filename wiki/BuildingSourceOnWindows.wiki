#summary How to build Turtle Arena on Windows
#labels Phase-Deploy

You first need to get the source code as described [BuildingSource here].

= Compiling the source =
Currently the best way to compile Turtle Arena is from a terminal using "make".

== Make ==
See [http://wiki.ioquake3.org/Building_ioquake3_on_Windows_-_mingw_and_msys Building ioquake3 on Windows - mingw and msys].

== Code::Blocks ==
  # Open engine/misc/code_blocks/ioq3.workspace
  # Select Platform
  # Rebuild workspace
  # Output will be in engine/build/

= Launching the game =

== Make ==
1. Copy the qvms files from engine\build\release-mingw32-x86\base\vm\ to base\vm\

2. In the command prompt change to the directory where you did the checkout. Example: cd "C:\\Program Files\TurtleArena\svn\"

3. Run in the command prompt: engine\build\release-mingw32-x86\turtlearena.x86 +set fs_basepath "."

== Code::Blocks ==
The projects do not compile QVMs, only DLLs. The DLLs are used for testing/debugging, while QVMs are used for release. "make" compiles DLLs as well as QVMs.

  # Copy the DLLs files (engine\build\cgame_release\cgamex86.dll, engine\build\game_release\qagamex86.dll, engine\build\q3_ui_release\uix86.dll) into base\
  # In the command prompt change to the directory where you did the checkout. Example: cd "C:\\Program Files\TurtleArena\svn\"
  # Run in the command prompt: engine\build\release-mingw32-x86\turtlearena.x86 +set fs_basepath "." +set sv_pure 0 +set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui 0
