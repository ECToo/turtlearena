Incomplete list editing information for new features not found in ioquake3.

== Shaders ==

=== vextexlight/novertexlight ===
_Search for "IOQ3ZTM // EF2_SHADERS" in the code to see implantation._

Support for Star Trek Elite Force 2 if no/vextexlight shaders.

Example shader:
{{{
textures/name
{
if novertexlight
	{
		map textures/name_novertexlight
	}
	{
		map textures/name_1
		blendFunc BLEND
	}
	{
		map textures/name_2
		blendFunc BLEND
	}
endif
if vertexlight
	{
		map textures/name_vertexlight
	}
endif
}
}}}


== Skins ==
Skins are used for players and CTF flags.

=== $(dir) ===
_Search for "IOQ3ZTM // $DIR_IN_SKIN" in the code to see implantation._

$(dir) can be used to specify the directory that the skin file is in.

Example skin:
{{{
l_leg_right,$(dir)/legs.png
l_leg_left,$(dir)/legs.png
tag_torso,
}}}


== animations.cfg ==
Player model config file.

=== soundpath ===
_Added by define TA_PLAYERSYS in engine._

By placing "soundpath NAME" in animation.cfg the client will use sounds from "sound/NAME/" instead of "sound/PLAYERNAME/". Soundpath defaults to the client's headmodel name (which is usally the player model directory name).

soundpath is used in Star Trek Elite Force.

Example:
{{{
soundpath raph
}}}
