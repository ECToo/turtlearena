#summary How to run the game from the SVN
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

*Runing the game* is split into three parts.

 * Getting the source
 * Compiling the source
 * Final setup and execution

= Getting the source =

You will need to do a Source Checkout, see http://code.google.com/p/turtlearena/source/checkout

= Compiling the source =

For the time being, see http://code.google.com/p/turtlearena/source/browse/trunk/tmnt-compiling.txt

Also see http://wiki.ioquake3.org/Building_ioquake3

= Final setup and execution =

== Windows (Mingw) ==
1. Copy the qvms files from engine/build/release-?/base/vm/ to base/vm/

2. In the command prompt change to the directory where you did the checkout. Example: cd "C:\\Program Files\TMNTArena\svn\"

3. Run in the command prompt: engine\build\release-mingw32-x86\tmntarena.x86 +set fs_basepath "."

== Windows (Other) ==
Other being Code::Blocks or Microsoft Visual C++.

1. Copy the qvms files from

 * engine/build/iforget/?.qvm
 * engine/build/iforget/?.qvm
 * engine/build/iforget/?.qvm

to base/vm/

2. In the command prompt change to the directory where you did the checkout. Example: cd "C:\\Program Files\TMNTArena\svn\"

3. Run in the command prompt: engine\build\release-mingw32-x86\tmntarena.x86 +set fs_basepath "."

== Linux ==
1. Create a link to each of the 3 qvm files in engine/build/release-?/base/vm/?.qvm in base/vm/
This way you don't have to copy the qvms after each compile.

OR Copy the qvms files instead, to allow running in Windows as well.

2. In the terminal change to the directory where you did the checkout. Example: cd /home/$USER/TMNTArena/svn/

3. Run in the terminal; Example: Run ./engine/build/release-linux-x86/tmntarena.x86 +set fs_basepath "."
