= Introduction =

This is the main page for how to compile and run Turtle Arena. It may seem a little complex at first, but it should be fairly easy.

= All Platforms =

For all platforms the first step is to get the source code.

== Get the Source ==
=== Archive ===
There are  source tarballs on the download page for Turtle Arena 0.4 (and later) released versions. Earlier versions included a zip of the source in main download.

Notes;
  * 0.4.x does not include data files or data source files in the tarball, they are in subversion.
  * 0.5.x does not include data files in the tarball, they are in subversion.

The data files are zipped and included in the game downloads (see `base/assets*.pk3`).

=== Subversion ==
You will need a subversion client, such as [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] (Windows), [http://www.rabbitvcs.org RabbitVCS] (Linux), or the command line program "svn"

Next you will need to do a source checkout, this varies by program.

Latest development code is located at
	http://turtlearena.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
