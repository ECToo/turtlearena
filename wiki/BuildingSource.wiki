= Introduction =

This is the main page for how to compile and run Turtle Arena. It may seem a little complex at first, but it should be fairly easy.

= All Platforms =

For all platforms the first step is to get the source code.

  * If you are using the source zip from the Turtle Arena zip releases, you can simply unzip the source.
  * Otherwise you can get the source code for a stable release or the current development version from the subversion repository.

== Get the Source ==
=== Zipped ===
A zip file containing the source is included with the zipped releases, simply unzip it.

=== Subversion ===
You will need a subversion client to get the source, such as [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] (Windows), [http://www.rabbitvcs.org RabbitVCS] (Linux), or the command line program "svn"

In Debian/Ubuntu you can install the command line program using
	sudo apt-get install subversion

Next you will need to do a source checkout, this varies by program.

Using the command line program you can use the following
	svn checkout http://turtlearena.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ turtlearena-read-only

= Linux =
Should also work on other Unix-like operating systems, like FreeBSD, but have not been untested.
