= Introduction =

This is the main page for how to compile and run Turtle Arena. It may seem a little complex at first, but it should be fairly easy.

= All Platforms =

For all platforms the first step is to get the source code.

  * If you are using the source zip from the Turtle Arena zip releases, you can simply unzip the source.
  * Otherwise you can get the source code for a stable release or the current development version from the subversion repository.

== Get the Source ==
=== Archive ===
You can download the engine/game-logic source on the download page for Turtle Arena 0.4 (and later) released version. Earlier versions included a zip of the full source in main download.

=== Subversion ==
To get the full source, including data source files, for Turtle Arena 0.4 or later you will need to download it from subversion.

You will need a subversion client, such as [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] (Windows), [http://www.rabbitvcs.org RabbitVCS] (Linux), or the command line program "svn"

Next you will need to do a source checkout, this varies by program.

Latest development code is located at
	http://turtlearena.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

You can also get the source for released versions
