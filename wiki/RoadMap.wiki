Work-in-progress plans for future Turtle Arena releases.

== 0.2 (Completed) ==
First stable playable release.

  * Standalone from Quake III: Arena
  * Bot support (botfiles based on OpenArena)
  * All 4 Turtles (Leo, Don, Raph, and Mike)
  * Melee weapons
  * Reworked weapon system (Only hold 2 weapons, default and a pickup)
  * Hold multiple holdable items
  * Shurikens (holdable items)
  * Maps for all gametypes

== 0.4.0 (Completed) ==
  * Fixed bugs from 0.2
  * Added music
  * Readded player effect colors
    * Readded to ui and q3_ui
  * Reduced overall number of TODOs and FIXMEs in the source

== 0.4.1 (Completed) ==
  * Bug fix release

== 0.4.2 (Completed) ==
  * Bug fix release

== 0.5 series ==
The 0.5 series focuses on completing tasks for 0.6, creating smaller goals with more often releases.

=== 0.5.0 (Completed) ===
  * DONE: Four player splitscreen.
  * DONE: Allow server public (internet) status to be changed anytime.
  * DONE: Allow non-dedicated internet servers.

=== 0.5.1 ===
  * Decide what format player models should be and make it doable if not already.
    * IQM? Multiple models or single with xreal-based skeleton animation blending?
  * (more undecided things from 0.6 plans)

== 0.6 ==
Focus on finalizing the game's branding (name, logo, etc), making it completely standalone from the Ninja Turtles, and solve other legality concerns.

  * Rename the game (to hopefully its final name)
  * Create new logo
  * Create new icon, menu background, and loading screen?

  * 0.5.1: Decide what format player models should be and make it doable if not already.
  * Remove the current players, replace with new characters designed for the game.
  * Add weapons for new players if needed.
  * Replace teams (names and icons), currently Katanas and Sais. Should per-team skins be added, or just stick with blue/red?

  * Clean up / rewrite shaders (do not have clear licensing for them)
  * Replace remaining OpenArena images and sounds.

  * Remake graphics at 4x (or 2x in the case of fonts?) quake3 resolution. (Many are already 2x or 4x quake3 resolution.)
  * Remake all (non-texture) images that do not have a svg source file?
  * Finish breakable/pushable objects and brushes code.
  * Switch to missionpack ui?

  * DONE: Four player splitscreen.

== 0.8 ==
Focus on map themes and multiplayer maps. Goal is the develop assets/skills for single player. The overall goal is to hopefully make Turtle Arena a complete (fully working) multiplayer game, comparable to commercial games.

  * Create scenery objects and brushes
  * Map Themes (Sets of textures, sky, models, misc_objects, and music)
  * New multiplayer maps using the new map themes

  * Finish '2D mode'
    * Finish Path system for players
    * Single camera mode for '2D maps' (set "2dmode" "1" in worldspawn to focus on local players), like the camera in Super Smash Bros. and TMNT Smash-up
      * Draw HUDs for all local players.
      * Focus on all local players (or all players in level depending on map settings).

== 1.0 ==
Complete the majority of the Single Player / Co-op code and have it playable.

  * Enemies for Single Player
  * Single Player Maps (at least one stage would be good)
  * Per-stage gimmicks
  * Save game system
  * Player Abilities
  * Remake UI with missionpack ui scripting?

== 1.2 ==
  * Expand Single Player / Co-op
  * Multiplayer improvements
