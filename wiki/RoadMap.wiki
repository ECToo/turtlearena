  * Hold multiple holdable items
  * Shurikens (holdable items)
  * Maps for all gametypes

== 0.4.x ==
0.4.x series focuses on players, map themes, and multiplayer maps.

=== 0.4.0 ===
  * Fix bugs from 0.2
  * Bring back player effect colors
    * Readd to ui and q3_ui
    * (Control melee trail color?)
  * Reduce overall number of TODOs and FIXMEs in the source
  * Begin work on 0.4.1 and 0.4.2

=== 0.4.1 ===
