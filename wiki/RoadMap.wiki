= Roadmap =
Work-in-progress plans for future Turtle Arena releases.

== 0.2 (Completed) ==
First stable playable release.

  * Standalone from Quake III: Arena
  * Bot support (botfiles based on OpenArena)
  * All 4 Turtles (Leo, Don, Raph, and Mike)
  * Melee weapons
  * Reworked weapon system (Only hold 2 weapons, default and a pickup)
  * Hold multiple holdable items
  * Shurikens (holdable items)
  * Maps for all gametypes

== 0.4.x ==
0.4.x series focuses on players, map themes, and multiplayer maps. The overall goal is to hopefully make Turtle Arena a complete (fully working) multiplayer game (Comparable to TMNT: Mutant Melee and TMNT Smash-up in someways.)

=== 0.4.0 (Completed) ===
  * Fix bugs from 0.2
  * Music
  * Bring back player effect colors
    * Readd to ui and q3_ui
  * Reduce overall number of TODOs and FIXMEs in the source
  * Begin work on 0.4.1 and 0.4.2

=== 0.4.1 (Completed) ===
  * Bug fix release

=== 0.4.2 ====
  * Four player splitscreen
  * Finished '2D mode' path system for players
  * Single camera mode for '2D maps' (always in splitscreen, optionally for everyone)
    * Like the camera in Super Smash Bros. and TMNT Smash-up
    * Basically have "2dmode" "1" in world spawn to tell game to tell cgame to only use one viewport in 'splitscreen' (for co-op in 2dmode), set "2dmode" "2" to focus on everyone (for Smash Bros. like maps).
    * May also add a cvar to override single viewport in splitscreen.
  * (Haven't decided other goals, see 0.4.x for ideas)

=== 0.4.x ===
Haven't decide what order these will be done in, but hopefully they will all get done in the 0.4.x series.

==== Likely ====
  * Improve player models; each player should have some unique animations, etc
  * Remodel and animate casey
  * Add more players (Mirage comic based); Foot Ninja, Foot Elite, and The Shredder
    * Room for originality, give different names? Evil Ninja, Elite Evil Ninja, and The Slayer?

  * Breakable objects and brushes
  * Pushable objects and brushes
  * Map Themes (Sets of textures, sky, models, misc_objects, and music)
  * New multiplayer maps using the new map themes

  * Remake graphics at 4x (or 2x in the case of fonts?) quake3 resolution. (Many are already 2x or 4x quake3 resolution.)

==== Unlikely ====
  * Have player models be MDR (Finish Misfit Model 3D MDR exporting)
  * Multiple levels of detail for players and other models
    * (Add a LOD converter to Misfit Model 3D?)

== 0.6 ==
Focus on Single Player / Co-op.

  * Enemies for Single Player
  * Single Player Maps
  * Gimmicks
  * Save game system
  * Player Abilities
  * Remake UI with missionpack ui scripting?

== 0.8 ==
  * Single Player improvements
  * Multiplayer improvements

== 1.0 ==
  * Polish overall game?
