TMNT Arena's multiplayer *map rotations* are stored in "[http://code.google.com/p/turtlearena/source/browse/trunk/base/map_rotations.cfg# base/map_rotations.cfg]".

= Format =
Each rotation set has a starting '{' and ending '}' braket. The type key set which gametype the rotation set is for. Only the first set with the correct type is used.

Each rotation set supports upto 32 maps (m1, m2, ..., m31, m32).  If a map is not in the rotation set for the currect gametype, it stays on the same map.

Single Player only uses m1, which is used for resetting the game in multiplayer when all human players Game Over)

  * duel - Duel
  * single - Single Player
  * team - Team Deathmatch
  * ctf - Capture the Flag (Default rotation set for oneflag and obelisk)
