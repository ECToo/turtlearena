Turtle Arena Single Player Ideas.

== Single Player Design/Story ==
  * Standalone, with inspiration from the TMNT 2003 TV series?

  * Something like "Turtles In Time" or maybe somewhat more like "The Hyperstone Heist"
    * Each stage has its own "totally different" environment
    * Per-level gimmick or two
    * Light on story (Meaning no long cutscenes between or in the middle of levels)
    * Have each "stage" contain multiple levels (Have all/most contain the same number).

== Stage Ideas ==
  * City / (New York City)
    * Underground, Sewer / Caverns
    * Aboveground, Streets / Rooftops
  * Country / (Casey's Grandmother's farmhouse)
    * Forest
  * Water (Surf level)?
  * Desert/Mountain
  * Snow
  * Foot base in space

  * Usagi's world?
  * Moo Mesa?
