Turtle Arena Single Player Ideas.

== Single Player Design/Story ==
  * Base on 2003 TV series or just be standalone?

  * Something like "Turtles In Time" or maybe somewhat more like "The Hyperstone Heist"
    * Each stage has its own "total different" environment
    * Per-level gimmick or two
    * Light on story (Meaning no long cutscenes between, or in the middle of, levels)
    * Have each "stage" contain multiple levels (Have all/most contain the same number).

== Stage Ideas ==
  * New York / City
    * Sewer and/or Underground
    * Streets and/or Rooftops
  * Country / (Casey's Grandmother's farmhouse)
    * Forest
  * Water (Surf level)?
  * Desert/Mountain
  * Snow
  * Foot base in space

  * Usagi's world?
  * Moo Mesa?
