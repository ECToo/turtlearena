#summary List of Console Variables
#labels Phase-Implementation

List of *Console variables* (also called Cvars) that have been added and removed from ioquake3 Team Arena. The list is incomplete and based on the latest changes to the SVN.

= Added =

  * scorelimit (Renamed from fraglimit)

  * ui_ffa_scorelimit (Renamed from ui_ffa_fraglimit)
  * ui_tourney_scorelimit (Renamed from ui_tourney_fraglimit)
  * ui_team_scorelimit (Renamed from ui_team_fraglimit)
  * ui_1flag_capturelimit
  * ui_1flag_timelimit
  * ui_1flag_friendly
  * ui_obelisk_capturelimit
  * ui_obelisk_timelimit
  * ui_obelisk_friendly
  * ui_harvester_capturelimit
  * ui_harvester_timelimit
  * ui_harvester_friendly
  * ui_spStage
  * ui_publicServer

  * g_spSaveData
  * g_saveVersions
  * g_saveTypes
  * g_teleportFluxTime - Time in seconds to be non-solid after teleporting

  * cg_drawSpeed - Draw player's speed on the HUD
  * cg_drawMeleeWeaponTrails - Draw (unfinished) melee weapon trails
  * cg_impactDebris - Set to 0 to disable impact particles. Set to 0.5 to cut in number half. Set to 2 to double number.

  * fs_pure - Read only cvar: fs_pure prevents sv_pure from being set to true when the default Pk3 files are missing or modified.

  * sv_public
    * 1: Advertise server on Internet, server will appear in the in-game server list. Technical: Server sends heartbeats to master servers.
    * 0: Doesn't list on master server, but replies to direct status requests (like if server is added as a favorite). Technical: Server doesn't send heartbeats to master servers.
    * -1: Don't replay to status requests, server will not show in the in-game server list. Other programs such as XQF it will show the server, but think the server is down (as it doesn't reply to status requests).
    * -2: Don't allow clients to join the game.
	* Note: If the server had "sv_public" set to 1 (public) and then is change to 0/-1/-2 (private) it will still be sent to clients by dpmaster master servers for up to 15 more minutes. Turtle Arena's MasterServer solves this issue, server will be sent out only 2 more seconds instead of upto 15 minutes.

  * cg_autoswitch
  * cg_zoomfov
